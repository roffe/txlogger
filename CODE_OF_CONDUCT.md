# The Dictator's Manifesto: My Code, My Rules

As the supreme ruler of this digital domain, I declare this project to be under my absolute and unquestionable control. This is not a democracy. This is a dictatorship, and I am your benevolent dictator.

## The Sacred Laws

1. I am always right. If you think I'm wrong, refer to rule #1.
2. Your opinions are irrelevant unless they align perfectly with mine.
3. Pull requests will be judged based on my mood and planetary alignments.
4. Code style is whatever style I used that particular day.
5. Documentation is for the weak. True programmers can read minds.

## Acceptable Behavior

* Lavish praise of my coding genius
* Unquestioning acceptance of all my decisions
* Immediate agreement with all my design choices
* Recognition of my superior intellect
* Coffee tributes (single-origin, freshly roasted only)

## Unacceptable Behavior

* Suggesting your way might be better
* Pointing out "bugs" (they're undocumented features)
* Asking why something was implemented a certain way
* Mentioning "best practices" or "industry standards"
* Using spaces when I clearly used tabs (or vice versa)

## Enforcement

I will enforce these rules with the fury of a thousand compilation errors. Consequences may include:

* Immediate rejection of your pull requests
* Public mockery in commit messages
* Assignment to maintain legacy COBOL modules
* Banishment to the Windows ME support team
* Being forced to use Internet Explorer 6 for development

## The Appeal Process

There is no appeal process. My decisions are as immutable as a constant in a functional programming language.

## Contact

Don't.

## Final Words

This code base is my kingdom, and in this kingdom, my word is law.

Remember: It's not about writing good code, it's about writing code that pleases me.

_By continuing to use or contribute to this project, you acknowledge my absolute authority and forfeit all rights to complain about anything, ever._
