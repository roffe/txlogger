            <h2>Information We Collect</h2>
            <p>txlogger does <strong>not</strong> collect any personal data, including but not limited to:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Name, email address, or other contact information</li>

            <h2>Data Transmission</h2>
            <p>
                txlogger does not send any personal data to external servers or third-party services.
                All application activity and data processing occur locally on your device.

            <h2>Update Checks</h2>
            <p>
                txlogger may check for a newer version by requesting the latest release information from our
                publicly available (<a href="https://github.com/roffe/txlogger/releases">GitHub releases
                    page</a>).
            </p>
            <p>
                When performing this check:
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li>txlogger sends a simple request to retrieve the latest available version number.</li>
                <li>No personal information, usage data, or ECU/vehicle data is sent.</li>
                <li>The comparison between your installed version and the latest version happens locally.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>
                If you prefer, you can answer no on the periodic update checks in the application and no network
                requests will be made.
            </p>

            <h2>Permissions and Diagnostic Data</h2>
            <p>
                txlogger may request access to system resources (such as file system access or network
                interfaces) solely to provide its core functionality, including:

            <ul>
                <li>Listening on 224.0.0.0:5353 (mDNS) to be able to discover txbridge devices on the local network</li>
                <li>Reading diagnostic data from supported vehicle control units (ECUs) via supported CANBUS devices
                </li>
                <li>Saving logs and configuration files locally on your device</li>
            </ul>
            <p>
                Any diagnostic or log data handled by txlogger is processed and stored locally on your
                device. It is not automatically uploaded or transmitted to us or any third party.

            <p>
                txlogger does not collect personal information from any users, including children.

            <h2>Your Rights under GDPR (EU/EEA)</h2>
            <p>
                txlogger is designed so that we do not collect or process personal data. In practice, this
                means:
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li>We have nothing to access, correct, delete, or export about you.</li>
                <li>
                    We do not perform profiling or automated decision-making based on your personal data, as
                    no such data is collected.
                </li>
            </ul>
            <p>
